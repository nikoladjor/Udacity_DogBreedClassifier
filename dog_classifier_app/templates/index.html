        <h1>Dog Breed Classifier</h1>

        <h2 class="important">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <p>This web-app is the capstopne project for Udacity Data Science Nanodegree (LINK HERE). The goal of this project is classification of dog breeds based on an uploaded image.</p>
        <p>
        After an image is uploaded, it is analyzed using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in order to classify the breed of the uploaded image (assuming it is dog). If the pre-processor detects a human in the image, it will proceed with the classification, so some funny answers are expected :).
        If, however, there is no human or dog detected, the result will be `None`.
        </p>
        <h2 class="important">CNN TRAINING</h2>
        <p>
        A pre trained <a href="http://ethereon.github.io/netscope/#/gist/db945b393d40bfa26006">ResNet-50</a> model is used for detecting a dog in the uploaded image.
        Using the <a href="https://keras.io/guides/transfer_learning/">transfer learning</a> approach and different bottleneck features, our CNN leverages pre-trained models and adds fine-tuning layers at the end.
        Step-by-step explanation of realization of the machine-learning part of this project is explained in <a href="/cnn_explained">jupyter notebook</a>.
        </p>

        <h2 class="important">USAGE INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <p>
        After clicking the start session button above, the virtual session will be started. It will prompt for the username, but the username is only needed
        for generating the random hash which is needed for temporary storage of uploaded images. This protocol is using flask <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/api/#sessions">session</a>.
        After that, the images can be uploaded and the predicted breed as well as uploaded image will be shown.
        </p>
        <h2 class="important">DATA DISCLAIMER</h2>
        <p>Since there is no limit to what image can be uploaded, the only guaranty is that I will not process nor use the images. The code is proveded on GitHub, and thus it can be seen there that the temporary storage is deleted after clicking stop-session button.</p>
