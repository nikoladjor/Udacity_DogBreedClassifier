        <h1>Dog Breed Classifier</h1>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2 class="important">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <p>This web-app is the capstopne project for Udacity Data Science Nanodegree (LINK HERE). The goal of this project is classification of dog breeds based on an uploaded image.</p>
        <p>
        After an image is uploaded, it is analyzed using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in order to classify the breed of the uploaded image (assuming it is dog). If the pre-processor detects a human in the image, it will proceed with the classification, so some funny answers are expected :).
        If, however, there is no human or dog detected, the result will be `None`.
        </p>
        <h2 class="important">CNN TRAINING</h2>
        <p>
        A pre trained <a href="http://ethereon.github.io/netscope/#/gist/db945b393d40bfa26006">ResNet-50</a> model is used for detecting a dog in the uploaded image.
        Using the <a href="https://keras.io/guides/transfer_learning/">transfer learning</a> approach and different bottleneck features, our CNN leverages pre-trained models and adds fine-tuning layers at the end.
        Step-by-step explanation of realization of the machine-learning part of this project is explained in <a href="/cnn_explained">jupyter notebook</a>.
        </p>

        <h2 class="important">USAGE INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <p>
        This application is build using a Flask-Login interface. After logging in, user can upload images which will be scanned and dog breed predicted from the uploaded image.
        In the admin area, one can see how are database models stored.
        <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
            The admin area is only for demonstration purposes, there is not default superuser account, every logged in user can see and manipulate the admin area. It is used in this project for further extensions.
        </div>
          
        </p>
        <h2 class="important">DATA DISCLAIMER</h2>
        <p>Since there is no limit to what image can be uploaded, the only guaranty is that I will not process nor use the images. The source code is proveded on GitHub, and it is not ready for pushing it to a production server, but rather should be used as a base for ML-based Flask projects.</p>
